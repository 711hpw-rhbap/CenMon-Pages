    <h1>Support</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the support page for <strong>CenMon</strong>. If you need assistance, please review the information below or reach out to us directly.</p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p><strong>CenMon</strong> connects to <strong>ZOLL XSeries medical monitoring devices</strong> to stream and display real-time vitals. If you're new to the app, follow these steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure your ZOLL XSeries device is powered on and configured for network communication.</li>
        <li>Connect your iPhone or iPad to the same network as the medical device.</li>
        <li>Launch CenMon and setup a monitor by selecting a device and patient to begin monitoring.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

    <h3>1. Does CenMon store or transmit patient data?</h3>
    <p>No. CenMon only stores vitals data locally on your device and does not transmit any patient data to external servers.</p>

    <h3>2. How can I delete recorded data?</h3>
    <p>Data can be deleted directly by deleting a patient record.</p>

    <h3>3. Is CenMon compatible with other medical devices?</h3>
    <p>Currently, CenMon is designed specifically for ZOLL XSeries monitors. Support for additional devices may be added in the future.</p>

    <h3>4. What should I do if my device isnâ€™t connecting?</h3>
    <p>Check the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure your iPhone or iPad is connected to the correct network.</li>
        <li>Verify that the ZOLL XSeries device is properly configured for network communication.</li>
        <li>Quit and relaunch CenMon.</li>
        <li>As a last measure, restart both the medical device and your iOS device.</li>
    </ul>
