    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: Tuesday February 25, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p><strong>CenMon</strong> is an application developed by <strong>Air Force Research Lab 711 Human Performance Wing RHBAP</strong>. The app connects to <strong>ZOLL XSeries medical monitoring devices</strong> to monitor and display real-time vitals from multiple devices simultaneously.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>CenMon only collects and stores data streamed from ZOLL XSeries devices and any patient records manually created by the user. The app does not collect any personal data about the user or their device.</p>

    <h2>3. Sensitive Information</h2>
    <p>The app does not allow users to associate actual patient PII (Personally Identifiable Information) with vitals collected from medical monitoring devices. This ensures no sensitive information is stored on the device.</p>

    <h2>4. How Data is Collected</h2>
    <p>CenMon streams vitals data directly from ZOLL XSeries devices and stores it locally on the user's device. The data is never transmitted to an internet-hosted server.</p>

    <h2>5. Purpose of Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The app collects data to display current vitals and historical charts for medical monitoring purposes.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>CenMon does not share any user or collected data with third parties.</p>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>No third-party services are used in CenMon.</p>

    <h2>8. Data Storage & Security</h2>
    <p>All collected data is stored locally on the user's device. No data is transmitted to external servers.</p>

    <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Data is retained on the device until the user chooses to delete it.</p>

    <h2>10. User Rights & Control</h2>
    <p>Users have full control over their data and can delete any or all data directly from the app.</p>

    <h2>11. Privacy Laws Compliance</h2>
    <p>Due to the appâ€™s design and data handling approach, compliance with privacy laws such as GDPR or CCPA is likely not applicable.</p>

    <h2>12. Tracking & Analytics</h2>
    <p>CenMon does not use cookies, tracking technologies, or third-party analytics tools.</p>

    <h2>13. Contact Information</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, you can contact us at:</p>
